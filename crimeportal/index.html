					<h4><span style="color:darkred;"><b>Cyber stalking</b></h4>
					<p><b>Cyber stalking is a new form of internet crime in our society when a person is pursued or followed online. A cyber stalker doesn’t physically follow his victim; he does it virtually by following his online activity to harvest information about the stalkee and harass him or her and make threats using verbal intimidation. It’s an invasion of one’s online privacy.Cyber stalking uses the internet or any other electronic means and is different from offline stalking, but is usually accompanied by it.</b></p>

					<h4><span style="color:lightslategray;"><b> Identity Theft and Credit Card Fraud</b></span></h4>
					<p><b>Identity theft occurs when someone steals your identity and pretends to be you to access resources such as credit cards, bank accounts and other benefits in your name. The imposter may also use your identity to commit other crimes. “Credit card fraud” is a wide ranging term for crimes involving identity theft where the criminal uses your credit card to fund his transactions. Credit card fraud is identity theft in its simplest form. The most common case of credit card fraud is your pre-approved card falling into someone else’s hands.</b></p>

				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<img src="img/social1.jpg"  class="img-circle">
					<h4><span style="color:lightseagreen;"><b>Social Engineering</b></span></h4>
					<p><b>Social engineering involves criminals making direct contact with you usually by phone or email. They want to gain your confidence and usually pose as a customer service agent so you’ll give the necessary information needed. This is typically a password, the company you work for, or bank information. Cybercriminals will find out what they can about you on the internet and then attempt to add you as a friend on social accounts. Once they gain access to an account, they can sell your information or secure accounts in your name.</b></p>

				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<img src="img/phishing1.png"  class="img-circle">
					<h4><span style="color:lightsalmon;"><b>Phishing</b></span></h4>
					<p><b>This type of attack involves hackers sending malicious email attachments or URLs to users to gain access to their accounts or computer. Cybercriminals are becoming more established and many of these emails are not flagged as spam. Users are tricked into emails claiming they need to change their password or update their billing information, giving criminals access.</b></p>
